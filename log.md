# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Began Memory game project, set up basic file structure and most of the html.

**Thoughts:** I'll need to do some additional planning and examination of what exactly I need to accomplish before I push forward with any code tomorrow. It is nice to have a footing to start from. Always makes moving forward with the project easier.

### Day 1: May 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished the basic html structure and began work on JavaScript file.

**Thoughts:** Today I got my html basic structure completely finished. Got the card flipping functionality working. I will need to create a mechanism to check flipped cards and reset them if they are not a match or lock them in place if matched. Something will need to keep track of cards that are matches. Getting the card stack to randomize is proving tricky. I set up some basic css in order to make working on the script easier.

### Day 2: May 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Most of the logic for the concentration game is now complete. Began theming of content.

**Thoughts:** Most of the JS logic now complete. A few quirks to work out. What is missing is a timer as well as pushing the congrats and  score to a modal rather then alert. For some reason I am not capturing my score content correctly (I am sure it something simple that I am overlooking).

### Day 3: May 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I worked on css animations, fixed several code css & js issues, and worked on artwork for the project.

**Thoughts:** I fixed the move counter today. Got new animations working and fixed some other ones to function as intended. Made a few additional css and JS code fixes. I spent a lot of time working on art for the project today. I got my hour of code work in but feel like I could have done more.

### Day 4: May 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I attempted a to fix a few issues with my code today, ran into a lot of dead ends.

**Thoughts:** I was attempting to fix several issues before I moved onto implementing the missing features. One fix I was attempting was to add empty stars after I remove full ones when the score decreases. Except I kept adding the empty stars infinitely. I figured out why that was happening and a solution to remedy the issue. I will have to restructure how the scoreCheck function operates. Today was a day of dead ends. I learned for sure.

### Day 5: May 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I was at a hackathon but did not get any coding in :(.

**Thoughts:** I was at hackathon and unfortunately for me my group decided to focus on solely idea development and not prototyping a working tech solution for the problem for which we had already created a rough blueprint of the requirements. I was too burned out when I got home to do anything but a few cli heroku tutorials.

**Link to work:** N/A


### Day 6: May 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I began working on the timer for my card game, as well attempting to improve how my win condition is checked.

**Thoughts:** I'll have to make tradeoffs for performance versus how I want the win condition to trigger. Previously I have the function for checking the win conding running on an interval which allowed the final two correct cards to be filled with color and animated before the win alert popped up. Now I have the win check condition being called only when the two cards are properly matched but no anim or color fill. The timer work has just begun. I believe I have everything I'll need to have it function but I will need to test it tomorrow.

### Day 7: May 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Timer completed. Modal implemented with final time displayed on it and also finally got the score to push correctly onto the win state!

**Thoughts:** I am pumped! I got the timer fully functional. With the score coming up on the win state. Modal has been implemented. Code cleanup, css adjustments, finalizing presentation, and art are what remain for the project now. After those are done I will cook up, plan, and implement additional features.

**Link to work:** [Concentration App](https://github.com/lourod1987/concentration)


### Day 8: May 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on issues related with modal in both js and css. Made some changes to html for modal.

**Thoughts:** Getting the modal to style as I wanted proved to be more time consuming then I thought it would. Fixed some JS modal output issues as well. Now that I have everything where I want it, I need to finalize presentation (css styles) and go back over JavaScript code and refactor for performance/readability (organization and structure).

**Link to work:** [Concentration App](https://github.com/lourod1987/concentration)


### Day 9: May 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: CSS Presentation work is completed along with some presentation modifications done through JS.

**Thoughts:** I finished the presentation work I wanted to and the project finally has the cohesive look I was aiming for. Their is some tinkering I want to do but it is overall done. I was about to start refactoring my code for performance/readability when I was testing and run into an annoying win state bug. I've been pounding my head against it for nearly two hours. Definitely time to take a break. When I do manage to iron out the win state kink, I'll move on to refactoring and responsiveness for the Concentration game.

**Link to work:** [Concentration App](https://github.com/lourod1987/concentration)


### Day 10: May 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Fixed win state bug. Added audio, audio calls, mute/sound icon, and funcionality for mute/sound. Fixed scaling issues with svg files. Began testing for performance issues.

**Thoughts:** Today I felt my project come together. Felt like all the pieces finally fit. I shared out my project on my live site so others could play and test theh game. I knocked out the win state bug by working on other stuff for the game while I felt stuck. This helped me think of a way to simplify what I doing which cleared the bug! There are performance issues on the Chrome and Brave browsers. Not to mention I am sure I can improve the overall performance of my project in general. I will work toward that tomorrow. Also still some other issues/trivial presentation things I want to get done. 

**Link to work:** [Concentration App](https://github.com/lourod1987/concentration)


### Day 11: May 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Added a few additional audio cues. Reduced svg file sizes down to a third total of what they were. Added in an empty star and improved the condition on which you lose stars. Fixed a win state bug where you could lose a star but still get the 5 star win state screen. Player can no longer click more then two cards at a time. Improved code readability and performance. Presentational improvements on modal win screen.

**Thoughts:** Today I did a lot more then I thought I would. I am really happy with the progress made. The performance and readability changes I made today go a long way to making the project ready to turn in. Their are still some performance enhancements that can be done to scale down system/browser cost. I am aiming to finish what's left of performance changes tomorrow. As well as knock out some responsive sizing. Also I can't believe I've spent nearly 2 weeks on this project, time flew. There have been challenges but I've learned a lot and it has been fun.

**Link to work:** [Concentration App](https://github.com/lourod1987/concentration)


### Day 12: May 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Tested additional performance improvements. Updated live site with latest code. In progress for responsive design.

**Thoughts:** Today was a little tough because a lot of the ideas and code I attempted ended in a wall of I can't get this to work. I will finish the responsive set up tomorrow and submit the project finally! So close.

**Link to work:** [Concentration App](https://github.com/lourod1987/concentration)


### Day 13: May 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Additional performance improvements implemented today. Redid a lot of the css for primary content displayed which reduced overall code needed for responsive implementation using media queries.

**Thoughts:** Spent time improving JS and redoing quite a bit of CSS. It always annoys me how it will take me a little while for what I am doing in CSS to click but once it does it floods back in and I accomplish a lot of good screen fluid code relatively quickly. Project looks ready to submit. I will give it a once over with a fresh pair of eyes tomorrow and then submit it, finally. So a day later then planned but I can definitely say that v1.0 of this project is complete!

**Link to work:** [Concentration App](https://github.com/lourod1987/concentration)



### Day 14: May 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: A few css adjustments. Commenting and styling JS code. Finished editing README and added some to do's to the planning md. 

**Thoughts:** Spent a lot of time making little css tweaks to improve the presentation of the concentration game. Added comments and made style corrections in JS. All of it took longer then expected. My project is submitted finally. I have that sense that it isn't good enough and I could make it better in a million and one ways. 

**Link to work:** [Concentration App](https://github.com/lourod1987/concentration)


### Day 15: May 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I did some quick fixes based on my project review to improve my concentration project just a bit more. One of which was a super helpful performance fix. I also built out a messanging app using Node.js.

**Thoughts:** Passing my project review and the performance improvement were an exciting way to start my day. Which I followed up by learning Node.js through building a messaging app. It was a ton of fun to unite front end and back end knowledge through the process. Still have bit more to go before the project is complete.

**Link to work:** [Node Messenger App](https://github.com/lourod1987/nodejs-messenger)


### Day 16: May 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Did some code debugging to help out a fellow coder. Worked with more node.js to finish up the messenger app. Coding callbacks, async/awaits, try/catch, and debugger. Working through some Jasmine practice as well. 

**Thoughts:** It was a mixed bag day of coding tasks. I did not get to do some of the stuff I wanted but got a variety of practice in and helped out, so it's a win in my book.

**Link to work:** [Node Messenger App](https://github.com/lourod1987/nodejs-messenger)


### Day 17: May 31, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished up the messenger app with some Jasmine testing practice. Started working on getting the leaderboards implemented into the concentration game.

**Thoughts:** I had a lot of fun working through the node.js messenger project and learned a lot. Still need more practice and knowledge base in order to get the leaderboards up and running. Definitely a trickier problem then I initially imagined.

**Link to work:** [Node Messenger App](https://github.com/lourod1987/nodejs-messenger)


### Day 18: June 01, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I read up on ECMA Script 2017. Fixed some layout issues with my portfolio. Tested out ways to get my leaderboard up and running.

**Thoughts:** I was definitely feeling the fatigue today. I oriented myself to do various other things with code like reading and watching some tutorials. Still managed to get some commits done today. Tomorrow I will refocus and work at knocking out the leaderboards again.

**Link to work:** [Portfolio Site](https://github.com/lourod1987/lourod1987.github.io)


### Day 19: June 04, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I knocked out some coding challenges on the Learn.co platform. Great refreshers and a few new concepts that took me a little time to solve.

**Thoughts:** I was feeling the burnout severley and needed a break for the past two days but I knocked out some coding challenges on the learn.co platform in preparation for a technical interview for possibly another scholarship. Most of it was just fun practice but a few new concepts were fun to tackle. Additionally although I mostly took a break yesterday as well. I did pop on to assist a fellow coder with understanding some concepts about functions and gave resources for learning tools to problem solve.

**Link to work:** [Learn.co Challenges](https://github.com/lourod1987/js-beatles-loops-lab-js-apply-000)


### Day 20: June 05, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed the final challenge on Learn.co for the technical interview.

**Thoughts:** The final challenge took a little longer then the rest. It was a fun challenge to think through and code. I am happy with my end solution and it reads pretty clean.

**Link to work:** [Learn.co - Deli Counter Challenge](https://github.com/lourod1987/js-deli-counter-js-apply-000/blob/master/index.js)


### Day 21: June 06, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code as practice through FreeCodeCamp lessons.

**Thoughts:** I needed to take a break from back-end so I've been working through challenges in freecodecamp and doing lessons in my Udacity front-end nanodegree program.

**Link to work:** []()


### Day 22: June 07, 2018

**Today's Progress**: JavaScript objects coding and refreshers.

**Thoughts:** Today I practiced a lot with JavaScript objects. Some of the content took a little while to click but once it does the coding exercises become easier.

**Link to work:** []()


### Day 23: June 08, 2018

**Today's Progress**: JavaScript do while loop, pushing odd numbers into an array, iterating over multi-dimensional arrays, and solving an objects coding challenge.

**Thoughts:** Had a lot of fun doing the various exercises on freecodecamp. It is great to practice concepts through problems and I'm excited to keep at it.

**Link to work:** []()


### Day 24: June 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: JavaScript parseInt, conditional ternary operator, and css practice.

**Thoughts:** Not easy to get back started today but I am looking forward to getting back into a solid rythm of coding again.

**Link to work:** []()


### Day 25: June 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: JavaScript ES6 and css practice.

**Thoughts:** Learned how to make a heart using css today. Really cool, has given me ideas for how to use css in alternate ways such as tool tips. I can hide elements with a specific class name and on hover reveal the tool tip for each element with that class. 

**Link to work:** []()


### Day 26: June 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: JS ES6 practice. Map and filter functions, rest, and spread practice as well.

**Thoughts:** Getting a hang of some of the concepts I've struggled with was really rewarding today. It is crazy how much there is to learn and practice.

**Link to work:** []()


### Day 27: June 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: JS ES6 practice including template literals and destructuring objects.

**Thoughts:** For some reason object exercises and practice keeps stumping me. I know eventually it will click but it is like running into a brick wall.

**Link to work:** []()


### Day 28: June 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: JS ES6, finished up destructuring objects practice and started on CRP project.

**Thoughts:** It was a busy day today and was hard to commit the time but I still went for it anyways and got an hour of work in. Tomorrow hopefully I can work out a lot more programming in. I have a lot I would like to get done within the next week.

**Link to work:** []()


### Day 29: June 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: JS ES6 exercises completed, A11y intro lesson is done.

**Thoughts:** Bit by bit I am making progress. Feels like I can't move fast enough.

**Link to work:** []()


### Day 30: June 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finally solved a profile lookup problem that had been giving me trouble. Finished a template string problem. I had the correct output but my solution was different then required for the exercise.

**Thoughts:** It always annoys me a bit when I'm required to solve a problem in only a single way. Glad I still managed to get some coding done even though it was father's day. I'm planning on starting a repository for all the problems I solve in freecodecamp so I can have a record of my solutions since none of the work gets saved into freecodecamp.

**Link to work:** []()


### Day 31: June 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: CSS exercises. Learned how bezeir curves work in CSS and how to effectively use them.

**Thoughts:** More code work completed in freecodecamp.

**Link to work:** []()


### Day 32: June 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript a11y exercises and practice.

**Thoughts:** More code work completed in freecodecamp.

**Link to work:** [FEND Nano Coursework](https://github.com/lourod1987/GwG_FEND_Nano/tree/master/ud891)


### Day 33: June 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: A11y lessons and did some practice with HTML/CSS/JavaScript.

**Thoughts:** More code work completed in freecodecamp and Udacity FEND program. Knocked out quite a bit of work today. Definitely proud of myself. Feel like I'm seeing the light out of this burnout tunnel I've been slogging through.

**Link to work:** []()


### Day 34: June 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: A11y lessons and practice with HTML/CSS/JavaScript.

**Thoughts:** Nowhere near the amount of work done today that I wanted to get to but it is a good sign that I am feeling motivated to get back at it.

**Link to work:** []()


### Day 35: June 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished up the freecodecamp accessibility section. Mostly html code with some css.

**Thoughts:** Productive and fun meetup today with fellow #Udacity scholars.  Excited to get more done tomorrow. Definitely out of the burnout hole I was stuck in.

**Link to work:** []()


### Day 36: June 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Responsive and flexbox practice in. Object practice and reading. HTML, CSS, JS work.

**Thoughts:** Had a busy past two days but glad to get some more done today. Soon I'll be on my to completing a lot more daily which is exciting.

**Link to work:** []()


### Day 37: June 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Array exercises. Lessons and coding practice with Objects, Functions, methods, callbacks, and solved some tricky map and filter problems with arrays that objects within them.

**Thoughts:** My pace is picking up. Excited to see what I can done tomorrow. Aiming to get to the next project by tomorrow but we'll see what I can actually get done.

**Link to work:** []()


### Day 38: June 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Flexbox exercises. Studied lexical scope, closures, immediately invoked function expressions with some practice mixed in. Finished up with some array practice.

**Thoughts:** Got a lot done today. Definitely not all that I hoped to accomplish but I am making steady progress. The progress includes improvement in my work completion pace and understand of content.

**Link to work:** []()


### Day 39: June 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on array exercises and practiced with JS objects. Specifically with contructor functions, this, and setting this for objects. For arrays I did exercises with push, unshift, pop, shift, slice and splice.

**Thoughts:** Slacked a bit and I am posting this a day late. I did the work though :)

**Link to work:** []()


### Day 40: June 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on array exercises and practiced with JS objects. Specifically with prototypal inheretance for Objects. For arrays I solved problems related to spread operator, indexOf, and iterating with a for loop.

**Thoughts:** Today ended being consumed by a lot of friend time so not as much work as I would've liked but it was great to connect with people I love.

**Link to work:** []()


### Day 41: July 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I completed more Object practice and lessons. ES6 function practice and assisted a fellow coder with problem solving for a project.

**Thoughts:** Got a lot done today. Even though it felt like a little. Definitely happy to be back on track with my work pace. Aiming to get to my next project within the next few days. Objects in JavaScript is a complicated topic especially since a lot of the terminology is layered it makes all reading about it very verbose. Which is cumbersome to digest as I approach some of the aspects for the first time. Granted I do feel like with all the work I've put in I now have a rich and powerful understanding and new skill to apply when I am developing my programs.

**Link to work:** []()


### Day 42: July 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked with ES6 functions in depth (defaults, destructuring, classes, super, and extends). The ES6 functions reading and exercises gave me some insight and depth I hadn't been exposed to before. Helped my friend with a vanilla JS lab, did some problem solving to get some functionality working and help push the project forward.

**Thoughts:** It seems that ever so slowly I'm improving in my ability to explain how code is running. Explain how to think of the logic. The practice is great for me but the reward of watching others understand what is going on is great.

**Link to work:** []()


### Day 43: July 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked ES6 built-ins (symbols, iteration and iterable protocols, sets, and maps). Got a lot of studying done, though limited coding myself today.

**Thoughts:** It kind of blows my mind everytime I go into these lessons and see that there is so much more I didn't yet know about JS or just JS ES6 and all of it's new and useful additions. Going over the built-ins today was immensely rewarding and I love being exposed to content I have not gotten anwywhere else.

**Link to work:** []()


### Day 44: July 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Promises, proxies, generators, polyfills, transpiling, and canvas studies today.

**Thoughts:** Not too much coding practice today but I'm cutting myself some slack since I studied a lot and needed to finish some lessons so I could begin prep for my next project. Which will definitely be a time a sink over the next few days. Then planning and execution of said project. I'm pretty pumped.

**Link to work:** []()


### Day 45: July 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Built a pong game clone. Using some html (canvas mostly) and a chunk of JS.

**Thoughts:** Todays project was fun and great practice. Learned quite a bit though the project took longer then I thought it would. More stuff to knock out and practice tomorrow. Huzzah!

**Link to work:** [Pong Game Repo](https://github.com/lourod1987/PongGame)


### Day 46: July 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on another html 5 / JS game using canvas and CreateJS. Mostly started the setup for the project and watched / played a wide range of games to see what my limitations may before starting on my own individual projects.

**Thoughts:** There is a lot of different libraries / frameworks out there that could assist me in completing my retro arcade game project. Spent a lot of time reading over a variety of docs and trying to see what my limitations would be. Honestly from what I've seen the limitations are mostly my own imagination. Looking forward to getting to work on my Galaga like retro arcade game. First though I want to complete a few more tutorials for exposure. Do some lessons to get some extra learning done. And do the frogger arcade project since it really seems like it will be easy.

**Link to work:** [Counting Game](https://github.com/lourod1987/CountingGame)


### Day 47: July 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on another html 5 / JS game using canvas and CreateJS. Got some solid practice with objects.

**Thoughts:** Having some issues getting one of the methods I need out from one file into my own. One solution may be to simply copy the exported Adobe Animate code diretly into my game.js in order to get it to work properly. I really enjoy working with objects and seeing how to interconnect my work. After all my research yesterday and some today I think I will be better off working with Phaser over CreateJS for my game. While CreateJS has a lot of support and awesome tools. They are not inherently game focused and thus lack some functionality that is beneficial for my use case.

**Link to work:** [Counting Game](https://github.com/lourod1987/CountingGame)


### Day 48: July 9, 2018


**Today's Progress**: Additional CreateJS practice through game projects and now testing out Phaser.

**Thoughts:** The CreateJS video tutorials I've been using are unfortunately outdate enough to where a lot of the content does not work as shown. I've managed to get some functionality through research but I would have to do a lot of document digging or search for more recent tutorials to fix all the project content. That said I intend to finish the tutorials regardless and learn what I can about basic code layout and intended functionality of the framework. Going to complete some Phaser work first though in order to get a better understanding of the framework for my next Udacity project creation.

**Link to work:** []()


### Day 49: July 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed a platformer using the Phaser framework and JS for practice. Learning the methods and objects that the framework uses to help create html5 games.

**Thoughts:** Working with the framework and learning it is a lot of fun. I imagine for more complex games not having an engine/gui interface makes some tasks extremely time consuming that could be more quickly done visually. Such as placing objects, enemies, and the like on the game screen.

**Link to work:** [Simple Phaser Platformer](https://github.com/lourod1987/SimplePlatformer)


### Day 50: July 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Additional changes to my Phaser game, assisted a fellow coder with troubleshooting, and did some array problem solving.

**Thoughts:** What I've learned about Phaser so far definitely seems like it'll be fun to use to build the Galaga clone project I have in mind. I really hope that the documentation is just as good as the examples available. I tried to get a double jump to work as well and it has been frustratingly alluding me.

**Link to work:** [Simple Phaser Platformer](https://github.com/lourod1987/SimplePlatformer)


### Day 51: July 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I built most of the core functionality of a frogger clone for a udacity project. Made awesome objects!


**Thoughts:** I set up my objects using ES6 classes today. It made me really happy to see just how natural it all came to me. I was definitely weary considering how badly objects have tripped me up in the past but the concepts and syntax have definitely clicked. I dived in and was able to come up with solutions on the fly and naturally. Which is a sure sign that I've integrated the knowledge. Looking forward to finishing up the project. Having some tricky issues with collision detection.

**Link to work:** [Frogger Clone](https://github.com/lourod1987/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game)


### Day 52: July 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished up the core functionality of a frogger clone. Simple collision detection working and started working on my galaga like game on Friday.

**Thoughts:** Definitely seems like I'm well on my way to completing the galaga like game I have envisioned. 

**Link to work:** [Frogger Clone](https://github.com/lourod1987/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game)


### Day 53: July 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I set up a basic start screen, got rocks to spawn, and bullets fired.


**Thoughts:** Taking a lot of time to understand the methods embedded within Phaser 3. Admittedly the docs are not the friendliest to read and certainly not easy for me to understand.

**Link to work:** [Final Frontier Phaser ver](https://github.com/lourod1987/Final-Frontier)


### Day 54: July 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I've been hacking away at my phaser galaga like game. Got some additional particle functionality to follow the player. Basic collision between the player, rocks, and bounderies. Messed around a little with MaterialJS embedded in Phaser.

**Thoughts:** Beginning to find myself frustrated with the slow going process of getting the game to work in Phaser. While the docs did excite me initially. They honestly are unreadable to me. I have no idea how to accomplish anything with the way the docs are written.

**Link to work:** [Final Frontier Phaser ver](https://github.com/lourod1987/Final-Frontier)


### Day 55: July 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked with Phaser a bit longer attempting to get what I wanted to work. I found myself unable to figure out how to get a change to occur on player when the player collided with an object. I began working anew using the Udacity game engine provided to get my game project working using their game engine. Nearly at the same point I was with Phaser version of the project.

**Thoughts:** Admittedly today I found myself kind of stumped and realized that my turn around time would be too long for when I want to have this done by 😕 Definitely feeling stumped. After all my trial and error and the slow pace I've been going at I realized I'm kind of stuck and more importantly that building out the game with classes in phaser is a bit a of stretch. I'd be better able to do that with the engine provided by Udacity. I swapped over and have quite a bit done already. I'm about where I was with Phaser. Going to see if I can use MatterJS for physics and possibly as the entire engine. So far the documentation is a lot more readable.

**Link to work:** [Final Frontier ver2](https://github.com/lourod1987/Final-Frontierv2)


### Day 56: July 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I did a lot of work with objects and functions for my galaga like game titled Final Frontier. I got player and enemy collision working, bullet collision, enemy and bullet removal on hit, screen scrolling, score increase for player. More to come.

**Thoughts:**  I definitely knocked out a lot of stuff today. Some of it was a little tedious to figure out and test but I'm really happy I was able to knock out a lot of my project goals successfully today. I have some more challenges ahead that may require some rework of the core engine but I'll be hard at work to get everything set up properly.

**Link to work:** [Final Frontier ver2](https://github.com/lourod1987/Final-Frontierv2)


### Day 57: July 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked through a tutorial for Coco's Creator, a 2D Game Engine with some TypeScript. Got some UI elements and text created for my Final Frontier game. Enemy and Player units now repel each other on collision. Working on getting the score text to update correctly.

**Thoughts:**  Even though it is taking time to get everything I want accomplished for the game it is coming along, piece by piece. I'm excited to get it done now. Really what's big that is missing is game states such as start/title screen, game (levels), win state, lose state, credits (possibly).

### Day 58: July 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Score text updates, a timer renders and updates, game loss condition triggers, roughed out some enemy x movement, and enemy spawning patterns.

**Thoughts:** Knocked out some more in my game project. Definitely slammed head first into a lot of ideas that did not work. Spent an infuriating amount of time attempting to implement a lot of ideas that went nowhere and a few that actually had simple solutions. Definitely makes me feel like I know nothing. On the other hand I am learning a ton from my failures.

### Day 59: July 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I reworked the base game engine to run off a function which has a switch that allows me to switch game states (start screen, gameplay, game over, etc). Fixed a flickering issue for my scrolling level, now appears seamless. Title screen works with flashing 'Press Enter' text. Game win state now works. Enemies now able to smoothly move across X axis.

**Thoughts:** Today is breakthrough day. I realized that my problems were occurring because of simple mistakes. Always the little things that get me, like not passing in arguments when instantiating an object. Now I've reworked the base game engine to run off a function which has a switch that allows me to switch game states (start screen, gameplay, game over, etc). Feeling super pumped! A lot to do before Sunday's turn in deadline but I've got a lot of the base systems completed.

### Day 60: July 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Game over, reset, and game win states working as intended. Rewrote more of the core engine, redid classes, and overall made better code. Classes made more flexible or more specific to accomplish unique tasks.

**Thoughts:** I slammed head first into one problem after another trying to get my game to work. Eventually got a lot of the problems and fixed but it was definitely a frustrating day. Got some additional art resources done for the game as well.

### Day 61: July 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Got an Alpha version of my game working and submitted for my Udacity retro arcade game project. Music added. Art done. Bug fixes. Helped out a fellow coder solve some problems. Worked with classes, functions, game engine creation, logic problems.

**Thoughts:** Feels great to have reached an Alpha stage of the game. Still needs to fairly critical bug fixes and functionality I want for enemy units and enemy spawning but overall I'm happy and impressed with the work I've done and what I managed to create.

### Day 62: July 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished up webtooling and automation lessons. Setup / troubleshooting gulp. Got eslint working in VSCode and with gulp. Sass files convert on save and more. Fixed an additional bug in Final Frontier. Code structure, formatting, and syntax fixes. Additionally worked to remove unnecessary files from the remote repo of final-frontier.

**Thoughts:** Even though yesterday I did not code. I got a lot of studying done. Today was no different and I got some coding work done in addition. I am feeling good and getting a lot of work done with my coding. I admittedly feel way more confident in my ability to code and problem solve after all the work I put into Final Frontier. I'll need to make some additional changes to the project before I resubmit it tomorrow.

### Day 63: July 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I went back through my Final Frontier project added comments. Fixed every bug minus 1. Added some new features including enemies that shoot, score variance, and a rewriting a better code. The amount of changes are honestly too long to list.

**Thoughts:** I honestly crushed it today. Definitely a productive day. I whizzed through bug fixing and implementing new bugless solutions. I felt like a wizard. Maybe I am now even if only an apprentice.

### Day 64: July 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Mix of cleaning up and commenting through my Final Frontier project. Working on setting up and testing webtooling, automation, and optimizations to my workflow. Helping out fellow coders and reading through documentation.

**Thoughts:** Working through others code bases can be challenging especially when you have to pick apart their code to figure out their though patterns.

### Day 65: July 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Mix of cleaning up and commenting through my Final Frontier project. Working on setting up and testing webtooling, automation, and optimizations to my workflow. Helping out fellow coders and reading through documentation.

**Thoughts:** Really struggling with resolving selecting elements with vanilla javascript. It is so annoying. Really makes me want to simply give up.

### Day 66: July 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Lessons, reading, and more work on assisting a coder with some project issues. 

**Thoughts:** Assisting is definitely taking more time then I thought it would. The problems with my fellow coders code feel like they are beyond my ability to solve which is super frustrating.

### Day 67: July 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Knocked out some TDD lessons and got some practice in with Jasmine.

**Thoughts:** Working with Jasmine was a lot of fun. I don't feel super well prepared for the next project but I am sure that between using the docs and comments on the project I should be able complete the next project with relative ease.

**Link to work:** [Jasmine Practice](https://github.com/lourod1987/ud549)


### Day 68: August 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Read through articles on JS object encapsulation, gzipping and minification. Dived into Jasmine documentation and got project 4 rolling with the implementation of a few more tests. The new specs pass.

**Thoughts:** It's a little tricky to think about how to run tests but it is clicking quicker then I would've expected. I'm excited to wrap this project up tomorrow and keep working through lessons.

### Day 69: August 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed more Jasmine tests for the Feedreader app. Worked on assisting a fellow coder.

**Thoughts:** Still having a hard time figuring out how to help my fellow code friend. Not sure why my mind is so mushy on code I've assisted with many times before but definitely hope to help her finish up her project soon. Knocking out the feedreader testing bit by bit.

### Day 70: August 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Additional reading on Jasmine and now just a test away from being done with all the specs for the Feedreader app.

**Thoughts:** Just a test away from being done with the feedreader app testing. Then I just need to add comments and set up the README properly.

**Link to work:** [Jasmine Project](https://github.com/lourod1987/feedreader-testing)


### Day 71: August 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on solving the last test I needed to create for the feed reader app. 

**Thoughts:** Getting closer. Took me a bit of experimenting but I finally followed the code to where I needed to grab my info from so I'm close. Comparison is ready just need a bit of async magic to get this set up complete.

### Day 72: August 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Solved the final test, added an additional test, change anon functions to arrow functions, added comments, and completed the README. Project submitted.

**Thoughts:** Mission accomplished! Definitely feel victorious. It was a little tough to figure out some things in working with Jasmine but really simple once I saw the obvious. Another project down, now for some chill celebration, and then on to the next.

### Day 73: August 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Read over my project review notes, it was a passing review. Completed accessibility lessons, dived into some git review.

**Thoughts:** I didn't code myself today but I will count it as I did a lot direct source code reading today. Which certainly contributes to my learning and understanding of code as much as writing some myself.

### Day 74: August 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Working on some cat clicker practice which involved reorienting myself since I had previously started this work 5 months ago. Mostly JavaScript and DOM manipulation for the exercise.

**Thoughts:** I spent time throughout the week doing some git refresher work and a reading through a bunch of code articles. The burnout was real and although I did coding related studies for a least an hour everyday throughout the week I didn't want to count days I didn't code or really work on solving / understanding problems.

### Day 75: August 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**:Cat clicker refactor of original code to adhere to DRY principle is still in progress. Working with HTML and JS mostly.

**Thoughts:** Gaining back my steam 🙂. A bit more done today. Slowly but surely getting back into the rhythm. It is crazy how burned out I felt last week. Want to knock out this refactor tomorrow and finish the MVC version by Tuesday at latest.

### Day 76: August 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Some more JS work done. Thumbnail selection now working appropriately.

**Thoughts:** Didn't get any coding in yesterday but tonight I did. I'm getting closer to finishing the code refactor for the cat clicker. Has definitely proved trickier then I thought it would be. Came up with a few clever ideas tonight and I'm nearly done.  Just need to get the code to work correctly for image increments onn click. Then on to the MVC version. 

**Link to work:** [Cat Clicker](https://github.com/lourod1987/cat-clicker)


### Day 77: August 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Cat Clicker refactor is now complete. Minor HTML tweaks and JS revisions now complete, old code removed.

**Thoughts:** I had all the functionality working with a single glitch early today. I solved that glitch by accident. Not really sure why. Going to look into it more and figure out why. Moving on to the Cat Clicker MVC version. I'll see what I can get done with it tonight.

**Link to work:** [Cat Clicker](https://github.com/lourod1987/cat-clicker)


### Day 78: August 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: MVC Cat Clicker exercise complete. JS Object work for exercise. Additionally I studied MVC/MVVM/MVP, how frameworks work (in general), and learning about KnockoutJS.

**Thoughts:** I found it straight forward to implement the MVC cat clicker and easier to read then the original. Certainly more practice on the horizon with MVC. There are several other exercises embedded in the MVC lesson that I plan on doing for more practice in the near future.

**Link to work:** [Cat Clicker](https://github.com/lourod1987/cat-clicker)


### Day 79: August 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Studied more about KnockoutJS. Did some MVC practice and slowly reworking my code.

**Thoughts:** Understanding how to break down frameworks and code in style was interesting to learn about. Definitely adds a lot of professionalism and is easy to apply. 

**Link to work:** [Cat Clicker](https://github.com/lourod1987/cat-clicker)


### Day 80: August 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I learned about BackboneJS. Now working through promises and doing some practice.

**Thoughts:** More framework detective work and it helps me to understand how these professionally used frameworks work in order for myself to write better code.

**Link to work:** [Promise Practice](https://github.com/lourod1987/practice-promises)



### Day 81: August 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: More promise lessons and practice.

**Thoughts:** It is crazy how frustrating it is to get stuck because a lessons content is out of date and the libraries no longer work with the current setup of a project / repo. I did manage to get some practice following along with the lessons but it was near impossible to do exercises on my own as I could not follow my output to learn properly by testing my code to see what I was doing incorrectly.

**Link to work:** [Promise Practice](https://github.com/lourod1987/practice-promises)


### Day 82: August 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I worked with chaining promises catching errors and moved onto AJAX lessons.

**Thoughts:** Learning AJAX has me excited and my mind is starting to storm ideas for additions to my portfolio, future projects, and client work.

**Link to work:** [Promise Practice](https://github.com/lourod1987/practice-promises)


### Day 83: August 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Ajax practice with XMLHttpRequest object. Completed an exercise getting a photo from one API and news articles from NY Times API 😎.

**Thoughts:** AJAX is super cool. Using XHR objects to retrieve data from two different apps and create related image / articles based on a query was awesome. Excited to do more with this.

**Link to work:** [AJAX Practice](https://github.com/lourod1987/course-ajax)


### Day 84: August 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Additonal AJAX practice. Using jQuery's $.ajax() method to interact with API's and the wonderful fetch API which works with Promises.

**Thoughts:** It was fun and I feel like I have a solid grasp on working with API's now. Which definitely gives me access to in uncountable number of resources and the ability to create resource rich applications.
