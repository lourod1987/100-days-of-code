# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Began Memory game project, set up basic file structure and most of the html.

**Thoughts:** I'll need to do some additional planning and examination of what exactly I need to accomplish before I push forward with any code tomorrow. It is nice to have a footing to start from. Always makes moving forward with the project easier.

### Day 1: May 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished the basic html structure and began work on JavaScript file.

**Thoughts:** Today I got my html basic structure completely finished. Got the card flipping functionality working. I will need to create a mechanism to check flipped cards and reset them if they are not a match or lock them in place if matched. Something will need to keep track of cards that are matches. Getting the card stack to randomize is proving tricky. I set up some basic css in order to make working on the script easier.

### Day 2: May 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Most of the logic for the concentration game is now complete. Began theming of content.

**Thoughts:** Most of the JS logic now complete. A few quirks to work out. What is missing is a timer as well as pushing the congrats and  score to a modal rather then alert. For some reason I am not capturing my score content correctly (I am sure it something simple that I am overlooking).

### Day 3: May 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I worked on css animations, fixed several code css & js issues, and worked on artwork for the project.

**Thoughts:** I fixed the move counter today. Got new animations working and fixed some other ones to function as intended. Made a few additional css and JS code fixes. I spent a lot of time working on art for the project today. I got my hour of code work in but feel like I could have done more.

### Day 4: May 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I attempted a to fix a few issues with my code today, ran into a lot of dead ends.

**Thoughts:** I was attempting to fix several issues before I moved onto implementing the missing features. One fix I was attempting was to add empty stars after I remove full ones when the score decreases. Except I kept adding the empty stars infinitely. I figured out why that was happening and a solution to remedy the issue. I will have to restructure how the scoreCheck function operates. Today was a day of dead ends. I learned for sure.

### Day 5: May 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I was at a hackathon but did not get any coding in :(.

**Thoughts:** I was at hackathon and unfortunately for me my group decided to focus on solely idea development and not prototyping a working tech solution for the problem for which we had already created a rough blueprint of the requirements. I was too burned out when I got home to do anything but a few cli heroku tutorials.

### Day 6: May 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I began working on the timer for my card game, as well attempting to improve how my win condition is checked.

**Thoughts:** I'll have to make tradeoffs for performance versus how I want the win condition to trigger. Previously I have the function for checking the win conding running on an interval which allowed the final two correct cards to be filled with color and animated before the win alert popped up. Now I have the win check condition being called only when the two cards are properly matched but no anim or color fill. The timer work has just begun. I believe I have everything I'll need to have it function but I will need to test it tomorrow.

### Day 7: May 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Timer completed. Modal implemented with final time displayed on it and also finally got the score to push correctly onto the win state!

**Thoughts:** I am pumped! I got the timer fully functional. With the score coming up on the win state. Modal has been implemented. Code cleanup, css adjustments, finalizing presentation, and art are what remain for the project now. After those are done I will cook up, plan, and implement additional features.

### Day 8: May 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on issues related with modal in both js and css. Made some changes to html for modal.

**Thoughts:** Getting the modal to style as I wanted proved to be more time consuming then I thought it would. Fixed some JS modal output issues as well. Now that I have everything where I want it, I need to finalize presentation (css styles) and go back over JavaScript code and refactor for performance/readability (organization and structure).

### Day 9: May 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: CSS Presentation work is completed along with some presentation modifications done through JS.

**Thoughts:** I finished the presentation work I wanted to and the project finally has the cohesive look I was aiming for. Their is some tinkering I want to do but it is overall done. I was about to start refactoring my code for performance/readability when I was testing and run into an annoying win state bug. I've been pounding my head against it for nearly two hours. Definitely time to take a break. When I do manage to iron out the win state kink, I'll move on to refactoring and responsiveness for the Concentration game.

### Day 10: May 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Fixed win state bug. Added audio, audio calls, mute/sound icon, and funcionality for mute/sound. Fixed scaling issues with svg files. Began testing for performance issues.

**Thoughts:** Today I felt my project come together. Felt like all the pieces finally fit. I shared out my project on my live site so others could play and test theh game. I knocked out the win state bug by working on other stuff for the game while I felt stuck. This helped me think of a way to simplify what I doing which cleared the bug! There are performance issues on the Chrome and Brave browsers. Not to mention I am sure I can improve the overall performance of my project in general. I will work toward that tomorrow. Also still some other issues/trivial presentation things I want to get done.

### Day 11: May 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Added a few additional audio cues. Reduced svg file sizes down to a third total of what they were. Added in an empty star and improved the condition on which you lose stars. Fixed a win state bug where you could lose a star but still get the 5 star win state screen. Player can no longer click more then two cards at a time. Improved code readability and performance. Presentational improvements on modal win screen.

**Thoughts:** Today I did a lot more then I thought I would. I am really happy with the progress made. The performance and readability changes I made today go a long way to making the project ready to turn in. Their are still some performance enhancements that can be done to scale down system/browser cost. I am aiming to finish what's left of performance changes tomorrow. As well as knock out some responsive sizing. Also I can't believe I've spent nearly 2 weeks on this project, time flew. There have been challenges but I've learned a lot and it has been fun.

### Day 12: May 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Tested additional performance improvements. Updated live site with latest code. In progress for responsive design.

**Thoughts:** Today was a little tough because a lot of the ideas and code I attempted ended in a wall of I can't get this to work. I will finish the responsive set up tomorrow and submit the project finally! So close.

**Link to work:** [Concentration App](https://github.com/lourod1987/concentration)


### Day 13: May 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Additional performance improvements implemented today. Redid a lot of the css for primary content displayed which reduced overall code needed for responsive implementation using media queries.

**Thoughts:** Spent time improving JS and redoing quite a bit of CSS. It always annoys me how it will take me a little while for what I am doing in CSS to click but once it does it floods back in and I accomplish a lot of good screen fluid code relatively quickly. Project looks ready to submit. I will give it a once over with a fresh pair of eyes tomorrow and then submit it, finally. So a day later then planned but I can definitely say that v1.0 of this project is complete!

### Day 14: May 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: A few css adjustments. Commenting and styling JS code. Finished editing README and added some to do's to the planning md. 

**Thoughts:** Spent a lot of time making little css tweaks to improve the presentation of the concentration game. Added comments and made style corrections in JS. All of it took longer then expected. My project is submitted finally. I have that sense that it isn't good enough and I could make it better in a million and one ways.

### Day 15: May 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I did some quick fixes based on my project review to improve my concentration project just a bit more. One of which was a super helpful performance fix. I also built out a messanging app using Node.js.

**Thoughts:** Passing my project review and the performance improvement were an exciting way to start my day. Which I followed up by learning Node.js through building a messaging app. It was a ton of fun to unite front end and back end knowledge through the process. Still have bit more to go before the project is complete.

### Day 16: May 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Did some code debugging to help out a fellow coder. Worked with more node.js to finish up the messenger app. Coding callbacks, async/awaits, try/catch, and debugger. Working through some Jasmine practice as well. 

**Thoughts:** It was a mixed bag day of coding tasks. I did not get to do some of the stuff I wanted but got a variety of practice in and helped out, so it's a win in my book.

### Day 17: May 31, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished up the messenger app with some Jasmine testing practice. Started working on getting the leaderboards implemented into the concentration game.

**Thoughts:** I had a lot of fun working through the node.js messenger project and learned a lot. Still need more practice and knowledge base in order to get the leaderboards up and running. Definitely a trickier problem then I initially imagined.

### Day 18: June 01, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I read up on ECMA Script 2017. Fixed some layout issues with my portfolio. Tested out ways to get my leaderboard up and running.

**Thoughts:** I was definitely feeling the fatigue today. I oriented myself to do various other things with code like reading and watching some tutorials. Still managed to get some commits done today. Tomorrow I will refocus and work at knocking out the leaderboards again.

### Day 19: June 04, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I knocked out some coding challenges on the Learn.co platform. Great refreshers and a few new concepts that took me a little time to solve.

**Thoughts:** I was feeling the burnout severley and needed a break for the past two days but I knocked out some coding challenges on the learn.co platform in preparation for a technical interview for possibly another scholarship. Most of it was just fun practice but a few new concepts were fun to tackle. Additionally although I mostly took a break yesterday as well. I did pop on to assist a fellow coder with understanding some concepts about functions and gave resources for learning tools to problem solve.

### Day 20: June 05, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed the final challenge on Learn.co for the technical interview.

**Thoughts:** The final challenge took a little longer then the rest. It was a fun challenge to think through and code. I am happy with my end solution and it reads pretty clean.

### Day 21: June 06, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code as practice through FreeCodeCamp lessons.

**Thoughts:** I needed to take a break from back-end so I've been working through challenges in freecodecamp and doing lessons in my Udacity front-end nanodegree program.

### Day 25: June 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: JavaScript ES6 and css practice.

**Thoughts:** Learned how to make a heart using css today. Really cool, has given me ideas for how to use css in alternate ways such as tool tips. I can hide elements with a specific class name and on hover reveal the tool tip for each element with that class. 

**Link to work:** []()


### Day 26: June 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: JS ES6 practice. Map and filter functions, rest, and spread practice as well.

**Thoughts:** Getting a hang of some of the concepts I've struggled with was really rewarding today. It is crazy how much there is to learn and practice.

**Link to work:** []()


### Day 27: June 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: JS ES6 practice including template literals and destructuring objects.

**Thoughts:** For some reason object exercises and practice keeps stumping me. I know eventually it will click but it is like running into a brick wall.

**Link to work:** []()


### Day 28: June 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: JS ES6, finished up destructuring objects practice and started on CRP project.

**Thoughts:** It was a busy day today and was hard to commit the time but I still went for it anyways and got an hour of work in. Tomorrow hopefully I can work out a lot more programming in. I have a lot I would like to get done within the next week.

**Link to work:** []()


### Day 29: June 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: JS ES6 exercises completed, A11y intro lesson is done.

**Thoughts:** Bit by bit I am making progress. Feels like I can't move fast enough.

### Day 30: June 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finally solved a profile lookup problem that had been giving me trouble. Finished a template string problem. I had the correct output but my solution was different then required for the exercise.

**Thoughts:** It always annoys me a bit when I'm required to solve a problem in only a single way. Glad I still managed to get some coding done even though it was father's day. I'm planning on starting a repository for all the problems I solve in freecodecamp so I can have a record of my solutions since none of the work gets saved into freecodecamp.
