# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Began Memory game project, set up basic file structure and most of the html.

**Thoughts:** I'll need to do some additional planning and examination of what exactly I need to accomplish before I push forward with any code tomorrow. It is nice to have a footing to start from. Always makes moving forward with the project easier.

### Day 1: May 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished the basic html structure and began work on JavaScript file.

**Thoughts:** Today I got my html basic structure completely finished. Got the card flipping functionality working. I will need to create a mechanism to check flipped cards and reset them if they are not a match or lock them in place if matched. Something will need to keep track of cards that are matches. Getting the card stack to randomize is proving tricky. I set up some basic css in order to make working on the script easier.

### Day 2: May 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Most of the logic for the concentration game is now complete. Began theming of content.

**Thoughts:** Most of the JS logic now complete. A few quirks to work out. What is missing is a timer as well as pushing the congrats and  score to a modal rather then alert. For some reason I am not capturing my score content correctly (I am sure it something simple that I am overlooking).

### Day 3: May 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I worked on css animations, fixed several code css & js issues, and worked on artwork for the project.

**Thoughts:** I fixed the move counter today. Got new animations working and fixed some other ones to function as intended. Made a few additional css and JS code fixes. I spent a lot of time working on art for the project today. I got my hour of code work in but feel like I could have done more.

### Day 4: May 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I attempted a to fix a few issues with my code today, ran into a lot of dead ends.

**Thoughts:** I was attempting to fix several issues before I moved onto implementing the missing features. One fix I was attempting was to add empty stars after I remove full ones when the score decreases. Except I kept adding the empty stars infinitely. I figured out why that was happening and a solution to remedy the issue. I will have to restructure how the scoreCheck function operates. Today was a day of dead ends. I leanred for sure..
