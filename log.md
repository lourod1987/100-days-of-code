# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Began Memory game project, set up basic file structure and most of the html.

**Thoughts:** I'll need to do some additional planning and examination of what exactly I need to accomplish before I push forward with any code tomorrow. It is nice to have a footing to start from. Always makes moving forward with the project easier.
