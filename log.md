# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Began Memory game project, set up basic file structure and most of the html.

**Thoughts:** I'll need to do some additional planning and examination of what exactly I need to accomplish before I push forward with any code tomorrow. It is nice to have a footing to start from. Always makes moving forward with the project easier.

### Day 1: May 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished the basic html structure and began work on JavaScript file.

**Thoughts:** Today I got my html basic structure completely finished. Got the card flipping functionality working. I will need to create a mechanism to check flipped cards and reset them if they are not a match or lock them in place if matched. Something will need to keep track of cards that are matches. Getting the card stack to randomize is proving tricky. I set up some basic css in order to make working on the script easier.
